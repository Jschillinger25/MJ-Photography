I've perfected my skills in this art and I'm attentive to even the most minute details. I want to respect you, your guests, and the memory of your experience as it's taking place  so you can trust that your time with me will be well spent. I'm efficient while also being aware of the time and your waiting guests. We won't miss out on a single precious shot though in the meantime!</p>
